/**
 *
 * This class provides the implementation for the aclonal evaluation
 * strategy.
 *
 * A aclonal evaluation strategy is characterised by heterogeneous
 * groups, that is, groups that are not identical in their control
 * structure. Therefore, multiple controllers are necessary to create
 * the group. As a consequence, the evaulation configuration is
 * generated by sampling controllers from the population, according to
 * a specific strategy. Here, sampling is uniformly random, but other
 * strategies are possible to form teams.
